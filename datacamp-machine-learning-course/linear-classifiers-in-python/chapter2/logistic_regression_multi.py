## By default, if you have a classification problem with more than one class, LogisticRegression by default creates the one-vs-all functions per each class

# Fit one-vs-rest logistic regression classifier
lr_ovr = LogisticRegression()
lr_ovr.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("OVR training accuracy:", lr_ovr.score(X_train, y_train))
print("OVR test accuracy    :", lr_ovr.score(X_test, y_test))

# You can specify the multinomial classification as follows:

# Fit softmax classifier
lr_mn = LogisticRegression(multi_class="multinomial", solver="lbfgs")
lr_mn.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Softmax training accuracy:", lr_mn.score(X_train, y_train))
print("Softmax test accuracy    :", lr_mn.score(X_test, y_test))
